Final Project from a Supervised Machine Learning class.

Project considered binary classification of loans into default and non-default using decision tree methods. Compared a full decision tree, pruned decision tree, and the ensemble methods AdaBoost and Random Forest. 

Surprisingly found methods were comparable and simplicity of a deeper, pruned decision tree may perform adequately over the increased complexity of ensemble methods.
